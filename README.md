# GSlicer

An automated testing tool for graph-processing systems via Graph-cutting.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Requirements

The code has been tested on a Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) workstation with Python 3.10. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

```bash
docker compose up
pip install neo4j
pip install networkx
pip install kuzu
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```

### 2. Testing Graph-Processing Systems

- **Neo4j GDBMS**: To test Neo4j, simply run:
  ```bash
  python ./databases/neo4j/test.py
  ```

- **Neo4j-GDS (Graph Data Science Library)**: To test specific algorithms, navigate to the corresponding directory. For example, to test triangle counting:
  ```bash
  cd ./graphs/neo4j/algorithms/triangle_counting
  python triangle_counting.py
  ```

- **NetworkX**: To test using NetworkX, run:
  ```bash
  python ./graphs/networkx/entrance.py
  ```
  Note that for NetworkX, we do not provide instances for applying graph-cutting oracles. Users may implement them using the `./graphs/networkx/dp.json` file after running the above command.

- **Kuzu**: To test using Kuzu, run:
  ```bash
  python ./graphs/kuzu/launcher.py
  ```


### Reproducing Code Coverage Results

To reproduce the code coverage results:
1. Manually compile **Kuzu v0.4.2** and install the **LCOV** tool.
   - See [Kuzu Developer Guide](https://docs.kuzudb.com/developer-guide/) and [LCOV Documentation](https://lcov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
   
2. Once Kuzu and LCOV are set up, run:
   ```bash
   python ./graphs/kuzu/launcher.py
   ```

### Reproducing Task Coverage Results

To reproduce the task coverage results, run:
```bash
python ./graphs/networkx/sample.py
```
